                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Internxt SL. (“Company”) when you access or use our websites, mobile applications, or other products or services (collectively, the “Services”), or when you otherwise interact with us. Our Services include the web pages at the internxt.com domain and our online storage services (“Storage Services”) that enable users to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (“Software”). This policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software. For details about the information these other devices may collect about you or your device, please see this help page. We may change this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our webpage or sending a notification). </p>

	        <div class="section__content">
                <p>We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as when logging into your Storage Services account by using your account credentials for a separate third-party service. We will receive information from that service as indicated in the relevant third party’s authorization screen.</p>

                <p class="section__subheading">Information Collected by Other Machines Running X Core</p>
                <p>Using Internxt's X Core software makes your computer part of a distributed network. This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions. None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web. We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you're sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy. Here's a list of some things that other people can learn about your computer. IP Address: This is your computer's address on the Internet. This needs to be shared so that other nodes' messages can reach your computer. IP-associated information: Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP. Network information: When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection's bandwidth. Node ID: This is a pseudonym for your computer. It's a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node. Disk space information: In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store. If you are not comfortable sharing this information, we suggest you do not run Internxt's X Core program.</p>

                <p class="section__subheading">Analytics Services Provided by Others</p>
                <p>We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf in connection with our Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and apps, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, app performance, time spent on pages and links clicked. This information may be used by Company and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand your online activity.</p>
